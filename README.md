I created this with the ambitous goal of creating a combat simulator for Pathfinder 2e, mainly to be used as a DM to simulate combat between multiple teams of NPCs to gauge the relative strengths of each other.

As of yet, there are MANY unimplemented features; the most obvious ones being 

* Persistence.  At some point in the near future, I want the NPC information to be stored in a database instead of just loading the characters from the Static Definitions library.
* Movement (And any form of a battlefield)
* Attacks of opportunity
* Special abilities and attacks like trip, disarm, etc...
* Simple reports showing the outcome of these simulations in aggregate.
* Combat visualizations, Replays, etc, allowing for someone to step through the sequence of an individual replay
* Simple AI for more intelligent NPCs to use those special abilities, avoid AoOs, and position themselves to avoid sneak attacks.
* Any magic spells or similar effects.
* Magic Weapons (above and beyond what can be simulated through just increasing the attack modifiers of the mob's primary weapon)
* Any form of character or NPC progression.   At the moment, if you want your characters to advance, you simply make a new static definition with updated stats.
* A portal for players and DMs to upload their characters.
* The concept of a session, where DMs can create a session, players can connect to it, and whatever live visualizations I can think of.
* DM and player authentication via social network identies.
* Advanced AI
